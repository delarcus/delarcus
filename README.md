🎓 I am Pablo del Arco Ortiz, a skilled Communication Engineer. I am pursuing a double MSc in Communication Engineering both in EURECOM (France) and Aalto University and will graduate in June 2023.

👨‍💻 Among the different projects and subjects I have studied, radio communications, IoT systems and protocols, intelligent buildings, mobile communications systems and electronics stand out. I am also fascinated by the world of entrepreneurship and blockchain.

🎸 Apart from technology, I also like to learn new skills. My main hobbies include acoustic and Spanish guitar, water sports such as surfing, as well as football and tennis.

📚 I also love reading books on personal development and stoicism.

✈️ Whenever I can I try to travel to discover new places and meet new people! So far I have visited 18 countries like USA, Italy, Sweden, Denmark, Poland, UK or Morocco, and I have lived in Spain, France and Finland.
